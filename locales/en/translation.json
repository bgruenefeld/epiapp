    "home-description-p1": "Genetic diversity in Labrador Retrievers is steadily declining, making it increasingly difficult for breeders to produce healthy, high-performing, and well-tempered dogs. A limited gene pool can lead to a higher risk of diseases, reduced performance, and unstable temperaments—challenges that responsible breeders face every day.",
    "home-description-p2": "With BreedOptimizer, we provide a data-driven platform that helps breeders make sustainable and well-founded breeding decisions. Using freely available data sources such as K9data.com, Sarita’s Blog, Oakmore, and other canine databases, we develop analytical tools to make the breeding process smarter, more efficient, and more transparent.",
